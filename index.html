      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a passionate learner and aspiring software engineer currently
        enrolled in the AltSchool School of Engineering program. With a
        background in industrial engineering, I have always been drawn to
        solving real-world problems and creating systems that work efficiently.
        Over the years, I developed an interest in technology and began
        exploring how software can complement my engineering skills. Aside from
        coding, I enjoy collaborating with others to achieve innovative
        solutions and continuously expanding my knowledge. Joining AltSchool is
        a step towards my goal of becoming a skilled developer capable of
        designing impactful systems that make a difference in people's lives.

      <h3>Why I joined AltSchool School of Engineering Program</h3>
      <p>
        I joined the AltSchool School of Engineering program for several
        reasons. I first heard about AltSchool Africa a few years ago but was
        unable to join at that time due to financial constraints. As a
        self-taught frontend developer, I saw AltSchool as an opportunity to
        gain guided learning through a structured curriculum, practical hands-on
        projects, and a widely recognized certification. I also joined AltSchool
        because it offers comprehensive training in the relevant skills needed
        to thrive in the job market. This program not only equips me with
        technical expertise but also connects me with potential job
        opportunities, making it easier for me to secure a position in the tech
        industry.
